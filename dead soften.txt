This takes the fundamental process activities of specification, development, validation, and evolution and represents them as separate process phases such as requirements specification, software design, implementation, testing, and so on.The waterfall model
Which one of the following is not a phase of Prototyping Model?Coding
This approach interleaves the activities of specification, development, and validation. The system is developed as a series of versions (increments), with each version adding functionality to the previous version.Incremental development
Which of the following statements regarding Build & Fix Model is wrong?It scales up well to large projects
RAD stands forRapid Application DevelopmentBuild & Fix Model is suitable for programming exercises of ___________ LOC (Line of Code).100-200SDLC stands forSystem Development Life cycleWhich one of the following models is not suitable for accommodating any change?Waterfall ModelThe software to meet the specification must be produced.Software design and implementationIt is a simplified representation of a software process. Each process represents a process from a particular perspective, and thus provides only partial information about that process. Software process modelsThis approach is based on the existence of a significant number of reusable components. The system development process focuses on integrating these components into a system rather than developing them from scratchReuse-oriented software engineeringThe software must evolve to meet changing customer needs.Software evolutionThe system’s services, constraints, and goals are established by consultation with system users. They are then defined in detail and serve as a system specification.Requirements analysis and definitionWhich is not one of the types of prototype of Prototyping Model?Diagonal Prototype
During this stage, the software design is realized as a set of programs or program unitsImplementation and unit testing
